(TMW_JavaJS)=
## Tracking of the transition of the SDT GUI from java to JS based rendering (MATLAB>=2025a)

Smiley convention : annoyance â˜¹ / errors-roadblocks ðŸ˜  / fine ðŸ˜Š

This was discussed in [ ref:!00Di00Ha1u.!500UU0V14ir:ref ] and on the Matlab exchange https://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/2179688-treetable-in-matlab-2025a. 
 
(TMW_uitable)=
## `vhandle.tab` rendering as `uitable`


Regressions/roadblocks
 - ðŸ˜  How to implement cell based tooltips ? 
 - â˜¹ How to analyze rendering performance on the JS side ?
- Use cases 
  - [TagList](https://www.sdtools.com/helpcur/base/sdtweb.html#_taglist), ChannelTab, [FEMLink](https://www.sdtools.com/helpcur/base/sdttab.html#tabfemlink)

TODO

 - TableCellRenderer
   - get TMW to explicit strategies for efficient partial update table 
 - `vhandle.tab.jsSafeCell` deals with rendering of [CinCell](https://www.sdtools.com/helpcur/base/gui_data.html#CinCell)
   - `pop` @TMW says it is possible, but I only find how to do pop on a column by column basis (not a cell by cell). Matlab `categorical`
   - `push` improve decoration ðŸ˜Š
   - `level` column of `TreeTable` is shown as decorations in the first column. Current implementation is in `vhandle.tab.level2iconkey`.
   - `tog` 
   - Need to clean all reference to javaframe 
   -  consider switching icons to svg : `'@matlabroot\ui\icons\16x16\yAxisView.svg'`
-  [uistyle Interpreter=html ](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2025b/matlab/ref/uistyle.html#mw_e57c82dd-e4a5-4f48-a8db-0561c0ee0341), tested in {m}`t_js('TutoTMW251001 -s{componentRenderer_proto} -show4')`
   -  ðŸ˜Š overal
   -  need progress on unicode.  {m}`reshape(char(9660+[-99:100]),10,[])` char(9660) <a style="font-family:Courier;font-size:20px;">:â–¼:â˜¹:â˜º:</a> Microsoft uses private area U+F04A
   -  ðŸ˜  how to do cell based tooltip ?
   -  ðŸ˜  how to mix fonts ? it seems possible in the latex side. Monospaced font selection for part of the row. 


DONE

 - In Java [`TableCellRenderer`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/table/TableCellRenderer.html). Writing a Matlab based `cellRenderer` is a major performance killer and will not occur. 
   - {m}`vhandle.tab.asUitable` will deal with filling a `uitable.Data` peer containing the view model
   - since the `uitable` will contain a view of the data rendering of buttons will be done by html styling in `[text,style]=vhandle.tab.jsSafeCell` 
 - {m}`vhandle.tab.jsSafeCell` need to render the basic button types
   - `text/double` : do nothing. @TMW Is there a performance issue if `ta.Data` a contains mixed type cell array ? 
   - `push` do a decoration around text. Currently MATLAB does not support inline reference to icons (they are placed in the style file for an unknown HTML rendering limitation @TMW it would be useful to have a clear answer of whether this will stay or go) -> use unicode/emoji 
   - `pop` @TMW said it was possible to have cell based popup menus, waiting for details 
  
```matlab
 % Possibly useful code 
 uit.DisplayDataChangedFcn = @(src,event) updatePlot(src,ax);
```

(TMW_tabbedpane)=
## Rendering of `TabbedPane` as `tabgroup`


Regressions/roadblocks
 - â˜¹ @TMW Missing closing button 
 - Use case {m}`t_js('uitree')` 

TODO
 - port use of `uitab` with `javacomponent` for the viewport rather than a `TabbedPane`
 - Report issues to TMW ref:!00Di00Ha1u.!500UU0WS8zX:ref

DONE 
 - URN for tabbed pane group inclusion `figure(1).Tab`
 - {m}`uf=sdth.urn('figure(ui.Tree).uitab{Tree}');`
 

 (TMW_dock)=
## Recovering a docking framework 

Regressions/roadblocks
 - â˜¹ no documentation of multiple docks (dock name associated with groups )
 - documentation of programmatic splitting ? 

TODO
 - continue revising {m}`sdtu.ui.dock`


DONE
 - added compatibility layer for >=2025a
 - AlwaysOnTop (bypass is probably possible )



 (TMW_splitpane)=
## Rendering of `SplitPane` as `uigridlayout`

Regressions/roadblocks
 - ðŸ˜ Missing interactive resize of grid width

TODO
 - Dock management (more than the single Figure dock is necessary for us (we need them to guide users in processes that occur). I will work on our transition prototype and come back to you for guidance. 

DONE


(TMW_errors)=
## Miscellaneous annoyance â˜¹ / errors ðŸ˜ 

- â˜¹ `quit` does not work for us in either 2025a or 2025b, we need to use `quit('force')`. Suggestion on how to diagnose the problem ? 
- â˜¹ Annoying caught error

```
figure(1);plot([0 1]); dbstop if caught error;print(1,'-noui','-dpng','xxx.png')

Caught-error breakpoint was hit in printing\private\setGraphicsProperty at line 0. The error was:
Error using matlab.graphics.axis.Axes/set
Unrecognized property YColorMode_I for class Axes.

```

- â˜¹ in the web browser there is no limit on the text length shown for a tab (makes using multiple tabs a pain). 
- â˜¹ setFigureIcon (a cosmetic issue for our customers selling products developed with our toolbox)
- how to use git to track a live script ? 
- â˜¹ named HTML color support (not a good idea that we are the only ones to support it)
- â˜¹ why do we have to do bypasses to open file at specific line {m}`matlab.desktop.editor.Document.goToLine` ?
- â˜¹ inability to have a stable link to [uistyle/interpreter/html](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2025b/matlab/ref/uistyle.html#mw_e57c82dd-e4a5-4f48-a8db-0561c0ee0341). ToDo SDTools implement `@MatlabHelp`
